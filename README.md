#### Requirements
* Python 3.6+.
* Python Control Systems Library `pip install slycot` and `pip install control`.
    * Documentation: [Python Control Systems Library](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.2/index.html).
    * Functions: [functions reference](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.2/control.html#function-ref)

## Fundamentals
### Modeling
In engineering, mathematical models are used to abstract the real world. This abstraction is done through formulas such as:

* Kirchhoff's circuit laws
    1. Current law: $\sum_{k=1}^n I_k = 0$
    1. Voltage law: $\sum_{k=1}^n V_k = 0$
* Newton's laws of motion $\vec{F} = m \vec{a}$
* Maxwell's equations
    1. $\nabla\cdot E=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$
    1. $\nabla\cdot B=0$
    1. $\nabla\times E=-\frac{\partial B}{\partial t}$
    1. $\nabla\times B=\mu_0\left(J+\epsilon_0\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}\right)$
* etc.

These systems receive and yield signals, which are also mathematically modeled. The __usefulness__ of the models depends on the accuracy, i.e., how close it is to the real system and signals.
